          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>All models must be at least 18 years old and comply with local legal requirements.</li>
            <li>The identity of the model must match the identity on the ID documents provided to the website.</li>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Models must broadcast from one account at a time.</li>
            <li>All broadcasts must be live. Recording videos and static photos cannot be broadcasted or promoted as live. Violators will be muted, and all unclaimed earnings will be withheld, along with all past earnings of the studio (if any).</li>
            <li>When online, it is strongly recommended that hosts turn on their microphones and interact with visitors. To maintain a good AIMeScore, ensure the microphone is enabled and not muted.</li>
            <li>The use of "BRB" (Be Right Back) screens, "Broadcast Starting Soon," or similar screens as substitutes for live broadcasting is not allowed.</li>
            <li>During a broadcast, you may only leave the room for up to 2 minutes; your absence must be notified in public chat. If you will be absent for more than 2 minutes, you should go offline in advance.</li>
            <li>Only models who are registered under the same account and approved can participate in broadcasts. Unapproved individuals must not participate.</li>
            <li>All broadcasts, photos, and videos must not contain watermarks, text, or logos (unless these elements are copyright protected and you are the legal and actual owner of these rights).</li>
            <li>All broadcasts must only represent the performers registered in the broadcasting account.</li>
            <li>If we cannot identify the model registered in the broadcast account, they will be asked to verify their identity on the spot via facial recognition. Please show your face—we will match it with the face registered in the broadcast account. If you ignore facial verification, the broadcast will be halted until you pass the verification.</li>
            <li>Cover and profile/avatar photos should only represent the actual performer or parts of the performer’s body.</li>
            <li>Profile/avatar photos must not contain nudity. All private parts of the model’s body should be covered.</li>
            <li>As a host, you must ensure that broadcasting from a specific location does not violate any regulations. We take no responsibility for your broadcasting location.</li>
            <li>Broadcasting in public places is allowed only if there is no risk of non-performers appearing on camera.</li>
